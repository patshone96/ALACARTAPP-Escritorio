# DESKTOP SIDE OF THE FINAL PROJECT FOR MY IT COURSE

Desktop app developed using HTML, CSS and server-side JS with Node.js. 

The desktop app is rendered using the Electron module and it is combine with the firebase/ firestore modules to connect to the Real Time Database. 

This connects the desktop app to the database which, at the same time, can be accessed by the  mobile app. 

From the Desktop side you can do a CRUD of the dishes of your restaurant, while on the mobile side you can only view the data, not 
manipulate or change it.
